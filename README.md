# base-react
My vision of a bare-bones React dev environment with Webpack. Just the boiler-plate. :) 

Includes support for ES2015, JSX, and CSS modules.

## Requirements
- Have Node version 4+ and NPM version 3+ installed.  

## Get Started
1. Edit application's name (and other info) in `package.json` file. The name of the folder containing the app must match the app's name specified in this configuration.
2. `npm install` to install all required dependencies. 
3. `npm start` to serve the development environment. 

## Production
`npm run build` to create a production build. 

The entry files are `index.html` and `index.js` in the `app` folder.
